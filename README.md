# Project_Euler
 My solutions to some Project Euler problems  
  
**031 is quite nice**  
I found a solution that takes linear time  
my first version needed huge amounts of ram  
I realised that i only need to remember the last 200 entries in the combinations array  
I will make a version that works with small amount of ram and linear amount of cpu time
